How to run: npx react-native run-android. I used a virtual device via android studio which you need to build an environment. I did not use expo. 

Refer to link to set up environment: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup 


Bugs: Clicking a card in the search screen and clicking back will go to marketplace screen. Search isn't 100% accurate (I used gte for where) nothing else goes by similar words.
